<span style='color: #A00;'><q>
    I don't see the emails that I posted to a mailing list
</q></span>

<span style='color: #00A;'>
If you are using GMail, remember that it only shows one copy of the
mail, and hides the one that comes back to you from the mailing list.
You can use the mail-archives to check if the mail has been received by the list

<span style='color: #00A;'>
Some lists only allow subscribers to post. If you use more than one email address, you might have accidentally sent a message from the wrong account.
